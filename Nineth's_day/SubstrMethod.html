        //The substr() method is similar to slice(). The substr() method returns the part of a string between the start index and  a number of characters from it. Substr() extracts length  characters from a string counting at the start of the string. If start is a negative number, the index satrts counting from the end of the string.

        var str = "Hello friends how are you";
        document.write(str.substr(8,8));
        //First 8 is start of index and second 8 is character number.
